Task description:
The Collaborative Document Editor is a real-time web application designed to enable seamless, simultaneous editing for multiple users. Built with React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface, Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time communication, and MySQL for persistent data storage.

Key Features:
âœ… Real-Time Collaboration:
Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously with immediate updates.
Changes made by any user are instantly reflected on all connected clients.
âœ… WebSocket Integration:
Socket.IO is used for efficient, low-latency two-way communication.
Real-time broadcasting ensures every keystroke is shared.
âœ… Persistent Data Storage:
MySQL is used to save document content, preserving data even after disconnection.
Document state is loaded when a new user connects.
âœ… Dynamic and Responsive UI:
React.js provides an interactive and responsive user interface.
Updates are displayed without the need for page refreshes.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js (Dynamic UI for editing)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js (WebSocket handling)
Database: MySQL (Persistent storage)
Communication: WebSockets (Using Socket.IO for real-time updates)

This project demonstrates the power of real-time communication using WebSockets and persistent data storage with MySQL, creating a fluid and collaborative editing experience. ðŸš€
